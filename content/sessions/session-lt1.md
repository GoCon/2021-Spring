Are you new to performance tuning and confounded by statistics? Do you wonder where these statistics come from, and how the optimizer gets the estimates from statistics?

Join me as we dive deep into cardinality estimation, how SQL Server uses statistics to build execution plans, where to find information about how statistics got used and why managing statistics is vital to performance.

This session will have awesome demos showcasing practical examples of how the optimizer uses statistical information for all those crazy queries you write.‚‡ã†ï¼

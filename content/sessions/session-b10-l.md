In my talk I'll present:
- Different ways of building Kubernetes Operators
- Demo of building the same Operator using different tools
- Methods used by the most popular Operators (Couchbase, Prometheus, MongoDB)
- Operator Capability Model and how it affects your toolkit
- Our journey with Hazelcast Operator

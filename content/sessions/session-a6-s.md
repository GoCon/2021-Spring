After so many breaches and passwords leaks, developers must reunite and reinvigorate APIs to protect their Applications, making the internet a secure global public resource, open and accessible to all. In this talk, I will cover how to secure your Go APIs using Decentralised Identity Tokens.

The APIs keeps changing, and the programming languages like Go are shifting the paradigm of API consumption. We often dedicate a lot of time to craft powerful APIs but overlook proper security measures. Setting up an authentication layer is, without a doubt, one of the most challenging yet necessary tasks within any web application.

In this talk, we’ll look at proper ways to secure our Go APIs with Decentralised Identity Tokens. We’ll go from learning what Decentralised Identity standards are, how the users’ identities are self-sovereign by leveraging blockchain public-private key pairs, why they’re the future of API security, and to put theory into practice we will build a real-world implementation using Go where I’ll show common best practices.

Static code analyzers are valuable tools that are easy to write and serve as low-effort bug catchers. Wonder how your IDE knows what it should be yelling at you? Want to make sure no bug (well, many bugs) make it into production? This talk will guide you in creating your own analyzer in Go!

Go has a simple grammar, which makes building tools for the language itself quite enjoyable. You will learn about AST and the packages used to create static code analyzers - like the ones used in go vet and go lint, and see examples of other analyzers to use in your projects.

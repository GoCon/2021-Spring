I'm a software engineer at Uber, working with microservices written in Go & Java.

I've also been teaching programming since 2015, leading lectures & seminars on various topics from the programming world to both aspiring programmers & experienced developers from Bulgaria, Serbia, Australia, Singapore, The Philippines & more. Topics range from Basics of Programming to Data structures, Algorithms, Web Development & even Blockchain.

In my free time, I'm maintaining [todocheck](https://github.com/preslavmihaylov/todocheck) - a tiny linter, written in Go which connects your TODOs to your tasks in your issue tracker.

Rashmi is a Software Engineer at LoopUp LLC. She completed her post-graduate certified program from Plaksha TLF in collaboration with UC Berkeley in Computer Science last year. Outside of her work, she serves as a Global leader at Women Who Go and is passionate for women in technology. A book in hand, earphones and a hot cup of chocolate is all she needs when in melancholy.
